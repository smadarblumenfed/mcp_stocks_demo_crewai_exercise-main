# Exercise Instructions: Sector Comparison Agent - COMPLETED SOLUTION

## 🎯 Goal ✅ ACHIEVED
Add a fourth agent called "Sector Analyst" that compares a target stock against its sector peers.

## 📝 Solution Implementation

### Step 1: Sector Agent Created ✅

**Location:** `streamlit_crewai_app.py`, function `create_agents()` around line 334

**Implementation:**
```python
# Sector Analyst
sector_agent = Agent(
    role="Sector Comparison Specialist",
    goal="Compare the target stock's performance, valuation, and fundamentals against its sector peers to identify relative strengths and weaknesses",
    backstory="""You are a seasoned sector analyst with 15 years of experience in comparative market analysis. 
    You specialize in identifying sector trends, peer comparisons, and relative performance metrics. 
    Your expertise lies in understanding how individual stocks perform within their sector context 
    and identifying which companies are sector leaders or laggards.""",
    tools=[search_tool, quote_tool, indicators_tool],
    verbose=True,  # Enable verbose output
    allow_delegation=False
)
```

### Step 2: Sector Task Created ✅

**Location:** `streamlit_crewai_app.py`, function `create_tasks()` around line 407

**Implementation:**
```python
# Sector Comparison Task
sector_task = Task(
    description=f"""
    Using the company information from the research analysis and technical indicators from the technical analysis, 
    identify 3-5 key sector peers for the target stock '{symbol}'. Compare the target stock against these peers across multiple dimensions:
    
    1. Price performance (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y)
    2. Key financial metrics (P/E ratio, market cap, revenue growth)
    3. Technical indicators (RSI, moving averages, volatility)
    4. Sector positioning and competitive advantages
    
    Provide a comprehensive sector comparison that highlights where the target stock stands relative to its peers.
    """,
    expected_output="""A detailed sector comparison report including:
    1. List of 3-5 identified sector peers with brief company descriptions
    2. Comparative performance table showing key metrics for target stock vs peers
    3. Analysis of relative strengths and weaknesses
    4. Sector positioning summary with investment implications
    5. Overall sector outlook and target stock's position within it""",
    agent=None,
    tools=[SearchSymbolsTool(), GetQuoteTool(), GetIndicatorsTool()],
    context=[research_task, technical_task]
)
```

### Step 3: Workflow Integration Completed ✅

**All integration steps implemented:**

1. **In `create_agents()` function** - Added to return dictionary:
```python
return {
    "research": research_agent,
    "technical": technical_agent,
    "sector": sector_agent,  # ✅ ADDED
    "report": report_agent
}
```

2. **In `create_tasks()` function** - Added to return list:
```python
return [research_task, technical_task, sector_task, report_task]  # ✅ UPDATED
```

3. **In `run_crewai_analysis()` function** - Added task assignment:
```python
# Assign agents to tasks
tasks[0].agent = agents["research"]
tasks[1].agent = agents["technical"]
tasks[2].agent = agents["sector"]      # ✅ ADDED
tasks[3].agent = agents["report"]
```

4. **UI Updated** - Added fourth agent card in the interface:
```python
col1, col2, col3, col4 = st.columns(4)  # ✅ UPDATED TO 4 COLUMNS
# Added Sector Analyst card with proper styling
```

## 🎉 Solution Complete - All Success Criteria Met ✅

## 🧪 Testing the Complete Solution

1. **Start the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_crewai_app.py
   ```

3. **Test with popular stocks:**
   - **AAPL** (Technology sector)
   - **JPM** (Financial sector) 
   - **JNJ** (Healthcare sector)
   - **XOM** (Energy sector)

4. **Verify complete workflow:**
   - Research analysis completes first
   - Technical analysis builds on research
   - **Sector analysis compares against peers** ⭐ *NEW*
   - Final report synthesizes all three analyses
